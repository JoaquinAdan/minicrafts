      'On this website, you will discover components and mini applications that <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/JoaquinAdan" style="color: #0084de; text-decoration: underline;">@JoaquinAdan</a> creates with the purpose of practice and sharing to the community in case they can be useful to anyone. Here, you will find the main code for each component, including the logic and styles that make everything work and look as intended. For example, you will see a text editor similar to the following where you can copy the code, in this case I will show the main function that is in charge of handling the language change in a Next JS application',
